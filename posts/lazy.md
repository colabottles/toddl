## Hello again

Well, it certainly has been forever and a day, hasn&apos;t it?

I am still around and up to some new shenanigans. Here's a rundown.

- Founded a startup
- Founded another startup (non-tech)
- W3C Safety &amp; Deception work for WCAG 3
- Weekly &amp; Bi-weekly calls with folks
- Decided to do one more talk at MagnoliaConf in October
- Recorded a podcast on Boagworld with Paul Boag and Marcus Lillington
- Health & personal issues because that's life
- and trying to land one more role in tech to pay the bills.

Personal little side projects aside, I try to keep busy so I don't get cabin fever and so far, so good but I am tired, boss. Real tired.

Hoping to get to this site soon and clean it up, change the design, and much more.
