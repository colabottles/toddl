    <section class="article__body" role="region">
      <p>I was <span class="italic">“That dude”</span>. Or <span class="italic">“That guy”</span>. The guy that thought his opinion was the one that mattered. It doesn’t matter I learned. I learned through a series of stupid tweets, Medium articles, and blog editorials. Shit posts and hot takes.</p>
<p>I was angry. Very angry. With a hatred for all things not me. People, places, things. If you had no purpose, if something didn’t serve me, if I was somewhere I did not want to be. I hated it. A seething, white-hot hatred.</p>
<p>Then I got sober in the late summer of 2013. That hatred grew exponentially. I was raw. I was newly sober and I could not medicate myself. I was even angrier.</p>
<p>I was the guy that trolled. I was the guy that used <span class="italic">“sarcasm”</span>. I was the guy that had to be right. I wasn’t. I’m not, I never will be. I had a lot to learn. I still do. I still even fall back into old habits. I’m constantly learning.</p>
<p>I saw someone on Twitter tweeting about going through a hard time and it brought me to where I am, where I have been, and the work I need to do to not <span class="italic">“be an asshole”</span>. Believe me, I am trying my hardest to right the ship.</p>
<p>That’s what I was. That’s what I am from time-to-time. An asshole. I remember telling a person on Twitter to <span class="bolder">“RTFM”</span> when they tweeted about not understanding CSS. <span class="bolder">“RTFM”</span> something I always loathed and abhorred seeing, but yet here I was. The hypocrite.</p>
<p>I don’t have many friends in this thing called <span class="italic">“the real world”</span>. I just don’t. Not since I stopped drinking. They all went away, as most do when one stops drinking to excess and partying non-stop. I kind of thrive with interaction online. Most of it on Twitter which I cannot stand to be on but use anyway (still a hypocrite).</p>
<p>I have to be vigilant with a couple things. One being how I interact. I haven’t been doing a great job lately. My depression has kicked in since some family issues arose starting last year, yet those are not excuses for my behavior. I have no excuses. I have learned to take responsibility for my actions. I call myself out.</p>
<p>I just started thinking about a lot tonight. I was that guy that didn’t care. Even as far as being called the <span class="italic">“Gordon Ramsay of web developers”</span> way back when all we knew of Ramsay was screaming at people and cursing. And I did that on this message board I was a moderator of. That's embarrassing.</p>
<p>99.95% of the time now I can see something and just walk away, scroll by, turn the other cheek, not a word. Total silence. Those times though, where I inexplicably get pulled in. Those are the worst. Those little moments, those lapses in judgment, those cost me big. I’m <span class="italic">“that guy”</span>… again.</p>
<p>Chris Coyier reminded me last night in an article that <span class="italic">“Being too opinionated about right/wrong in tooling choices isn’t helpful.”</span> Well that goes the same regarding interaction in life. Being too opinionated isn’t helpful. Sarcasm isn’t needed everywhere. I’m not Don Rickles. This isn’t a Comedy Central Roast.</p>
<p>I was <span class="italic">“That dude”</span>. That is not helpful. I have to be better than I was yesterday. I used to say that to myself every day, then I stopped. Then I stopped being better than yesterday and it shows. So, I wake up and right next to me is my piece of paper sitting right there which reads, <span class="italic">“Be better than you were yesterday”</span>.</p>
<img src="/img/notetoself.png" alt="A piece of paper on my side table that reads, 'Be better than you were yesterday'." />
<p>It’s the first thing I look at when my eyes open. Be helpful, not an asshole.</p>
