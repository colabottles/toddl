## Roach Motels

Not the kind you book that are not clean and are not great to stay in. The roach motels that are laid out all over to trap users into and like the Eagles said&colon;

> You can check out any time you like, but you can never leave.

Here is a couple examples.

Fun huh?

The pattern with roach motels focuses in on wearing a user out. Making you so tired, exhausted, irritated, mad, angry, pissed so that you give up and just say to hell with it, that you are not going to unsubscribe because it is a pain in the ass. Period.

That pattern, to trap you, to make you think twice. To make you stop and say, &ldquo;Is it worth the hassle&quest&rdquo; That stopping cue.

## The Stopping cue

The stopping cue is that point in the interaction where you are stopped. Whether it is an infinite scroll that the developer or designer has taken away (I will get to that in another post soon) or a roach motel that wears you out so you stop. That's the cue we need to get rid of regarding these patterns. Anti-pattern or deceptive pattern, that cue, needs to go if it is used for nefarious reasons and they usually are used just for that.

From an interview with Aza Raskin, the inventor of infinite scroll;

> “I regret that I didn’t think more about how this thing would be used,” he told The Times. He compares the feature to a study in 2005 that gave users bowls of soups that constantly refilled via a tube underneath the bowl. Participants ate 70 per cent more soup than those with normal bowls and did not even notice.
>
> “I know as a designer that by taking away the stopping cue, I can make you do what I want you to do,” Mr Raskin, a former head of user design at the browser Mozilla, said.

Mr. Raskin went on to say;

> “I contributed to this and I have been complicit,” he said. “This story that we had all been telling ourselves that we were making the world better with technology, that story has been undone, I can’t tell myself that story any more.”
>
> He added: “This is a profound moment in our species. We are losing control of the tools we made.”

## Forced Continuity

This goes hand in hand with the roach motel, as well as other deceptive patterns. Infinite scroll again, for example. That forced continuity when the stopping cue (in this case the &ldquo;load more&rdquo; prompt or button) and the developer/designer has you in the palm of their hand. You are forced to continue the pattern you did not want to go down and find yourself exhausted, frustrated, angry, mad by the time you get to where you need to go but you have either given up and left or you have just said, &ldquo;To hell with it&rdquo; and you are done. Or you're so exhausted you don't remember what you were doing and you just give in and stay subscribed, or you keep scrolling, or you keep clicking, or you keep doing whatever it is you are doing.

Forced continuity is your captor. The roach motel is where you are being kept hostage.
