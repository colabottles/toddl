Former web developer and accessibility engineer from Portland, Maine now living in Phoenix, Arizona. I had been a developer for most of my 26 years professionally in tech before moving to accessibility. Now, moving away from accessibility and focusing back on development and founding a company.

I could tell you that I have a passion for this and a drive for that, but what I really want you to know is how much I love what I do, share what I have learned, and educate people in the areas I work in mostly. I have loved programming since the beginning when I learned Commodore BASIC and Scheme.

You can find more about my work on [my Github page](https://github.com/colabottles) or[my CodePen page](https://codepen.io/colabottles).
